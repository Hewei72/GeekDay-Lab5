# GeekDay-Lab5
In this lab we will use Python to retrieve information from the XtremIO API as well as to make changes in the array. This will illustrate the functionality DevOps teams demand from the infratructure.

# About GEEK-DAY
Geek-day is an internal initiative in my company to educate my pre-sales colleagues in new transformational technologies such as Cloud Native Applications, Agile development and DevOps. I have open-sourced the practical components of this training and made them available as repos in this Github page.

There are two parts:
 * In part 1 (Lab 1, Lab 2 and and "SEconference2016") we get familiarised with Pivotal Cloud Foundry as an example of structured PaaS as well as services typically used by Cloud Native apps, such as object storage and NoSQL databases. Lab 1 and Lab 2 are intermediate steps towards the final goal of deploying the companion app for the ANZ EMC SE Conference 2016. See that repo for more details.
NOTE: There is a good chance that the original app is still running here:

 * In part 2 (lab 4 and lab 5) we get an introduction to dealing with API's through some publicly available ones as well as the XtremIO API. The goal is to get a bit hands-on with DevOps, particularly its focus on automation
